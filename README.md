<h1 align="center">Welcome to SkillSync: Bridging Skills to Startups!🛠️</h1>
<br/>

<h2>Problem</h2>

Both skilled students and startups face challenges in connecting with each other for gig-based work and direct hiring. Students often struggle to find suitable gigs that align with their skills and educational background, whereas startups have difficulties in finding skilled talent that fits their needs. The traditional job portals often don't meet these specialized requirements.

<h2>Solution</h2>

SkillSync is a MERN stack application designed to bring skilled students and startups closer than ever before. Our platform offers a centralized space where users can search for gigs, communicate directly with gig creators, and even leave reviews and ratings. Startups can accelerate their project timelines and foster direct hiring, all while promoting skill-based learning.

<h2>About the Project</h2>

Built with the MERN stack, SkillSync uses React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. This ensures a scalable, high-performance, and seamless user experience.
